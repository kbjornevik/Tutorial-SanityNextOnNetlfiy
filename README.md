# Frontend Tutorial Knuts TeknoBlog
# This is a tutorial created to test out Sanity with Next running on a Netlify site.

This repository is to support my artickel on how to build an blog with structured content using Sanity.io and Next.

#CORS
In order to allow the frontend server to  get data from Sanity, you have to add its domain to CORS-settings. In the sanity manage  shell you'll will find the projectâ€™s settings.Add http://localhost:3000 as a new origin.

#Getting started

Install the package
 npm install

 Then run the development server:
 npm run dev
   ## or 
   yarn dev

Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.
