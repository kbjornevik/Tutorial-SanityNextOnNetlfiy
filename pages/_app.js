//  When using Next.js youâ€™ll most likely need to override the global App component to get access to some features like 
// persisting state, or global layouts. This can be done by creating a file _app.js directly in the ./pages/ folder. 
// If this file exists, then Next.js will use this instead of the default App.
// The Component prop is the page view that will be rendered. We can use this to pass our own props to or wrap with layout/context components.
// The pageProps prop is the props that each page will receive when rendered. It is important to remember to pass these along.
